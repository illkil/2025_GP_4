# Wujed – AI-Powered Lost & Found System

Wujed is an intelligent digital platform designed to help the residents of Riyadh recover lost items more efficiently. The system allows users to report lost or found items by uploading a photo, entering a short description, and providing the location. Using artificial intelligence, Wujed compares text and image data to find potential matches between reports. When a match is detected, both users are notified and can communicate through a secure in-app chat to confirm the item and arrange its return.
